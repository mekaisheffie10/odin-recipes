The Odin Project Stuff 
My current project is to be able to successfully update the git and if I am able to do that 
I am well on my way to becoming a super coder ! 
I hope to advance my skills in tech and hope to win at the finish line! 
I think that my drive and determination is what will get me to the finish line! 
Thank You! That ends my TED talk !
